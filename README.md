# Demi Ped Manager

A FiveM script to spawn, animate, and manage NPCs in your GTA V server.

## Features

With this script, you can:

- Spawn NPC characters (Peds) with specific models at designated coordinates.
- Assign custom scenarios, animations, and props to the Peds.
- Setup custom event targets or textUIs for the Peds.
- Handle spawning and despawning of Peds with custom callbacks.
- Despawn the Peds when the player is not in their vicinity to save resources.

## Usage

This script uses the `Peds` table in `client/pedList.lua` to define the NPC entities. Each entry in the table corresponds to a single Ped and their respective configurations.

Here's an example of a Ped configuration:

```lua
{
    model = "s_f_y_airhostess_01", --ped model
    coords = vec4(3.1629, -1309.7675, 30.1646, 7.2837), -- location of the ped
    renderDistance = 30.0, -- how close to coords you have to be to spawn the ped
    scenario = "WORLD_HUMAN_CLIPBOARD", --optionally use a scenario or an animation.
    animation = { -- animation data
        dict = "amb@code_human_in_bus_passenger_idles@female@tablet@idle_a",
        anim = "idle_a",
        flag = 63
    },
    prop = { -- prop attachment data
        propModel = "prop_cs_tablet",
        bone = 28422,
        rotation = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.03),
        offset = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.03),
    },
    targetOptions = { -- standard ox_target options that will apply to the ped
        {
            icon = 'fas fa-money-bill-alt',
            label = 'something',
            serverEvent = "some event"
        },
    },
    textUI = { -- this is an alternative way to interact with the peds. although you could have this and target if you really want
        text = 'Say Hi!', --text displayed when within active distance
        timeout = 1000, --how long the interact is disabled (prevents spamming E on ped)
        drawDistance = 5.0, -- how far away you can see the first small circle
        activeDistance = 1.0, -- how far away you can interact with the ped (press E)
        onSelect = function(self) -- triggers when pressing E within active distance
            print('hello')
        end
    }
    onInit = function(self) -- Callback function after the Ped is spawned
        print(("ped handle is %s"):format(self.ped))
    end,
    onDespawn = function(self) -- Callback function before the Ped is despawned
        print(("ped handle is %s"):format(self.ped))
    end
}
```
